      "description": "<p>When I began studying Creative Tech in undergrad I specialized in working with audio, learning to effectively design soundscapes and produce music digitally. I designed block diagrams for complex speaker systems, I practiced mixing down multi-track recordings, I experimented with Max patching in Ableton. With my background as a musician and aptitude for digital production, I quickly excelled in my courses and looked to expand my abilities.</p><p>In 2018, I took the skills I had learned in class combined with the techniques I discovered in my private studies and took my first big step: I recorded, produced, edited, mixed, and mastered <a href= \"https://open.spotify.com/album/5YpzqlqKHUYos6QKb4mFmF?si=drPcnlAIQIWlAt8wSt_dSg\">an album</a> for local acapella group <a href= \"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4JJXEEoCeXddftlPVYJ0ZJ?si=z9tXtKlySnuldywg6OVH4Q\">Secondary Dominance</a>. Not wanting to limit myself to one medium, I pushed myself to grow in more of my passions- my team placed second in our local game jam, creating a 2D platformer based on our custom physics engine. Inspired by my work in game development, I started <a href= \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16GTI0oCuSD4f87CBl6j0-lmhx-ZDq065/view?usp=drive_link\">experimenting with virtual reality</a> and soon began working with <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/roydmagnuson/\">Dr. Roy Magnuson</a> to forge a path in the nascent field of VR while helping found the ISU XR lab in 2020.</p>",

      "description": "<p>After graduation, I worked on a number of different projects to further refine my skills. I produced <a href= \"https://open.spotify.com/track/7w2S033TVwX90zWNRXwwpA?si=e490e7177d2448db\">another single</a> for Secondary Dominance, recorded the ISU drumline for a university ad spot, and continued making games in my free time. Before long, I found a job at Palma Entertainment where I could utilize a variety of my skills.</p><p>My first project at Palma Entertainment drew on my experience in graphic design, as I produced a logo for their new performance space, Venue 309. Once I was more firmly established in the company, I began contributing more to the private events that they would operate. I traveled to different venues to set up and operate professional audio equipment for events like weddings or large corporate gatherings. Eventually the company wanted to expand into music production, and I was selected to design the new recording studio. I designated all the requisite gear for purchase, directed the relevant carpentry for the new space, and assembled the brand new studio that I was responsible for operating.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Riley started out as musician and street performance artist, and now blends painting and photography with audio, video, and computer multimedia to create what he calls 'Music and Multimedia Artworks.' Riley's innovations in using multimedia to express art have created a youth culture movement in his town of Portland, in which he remains at the forefront. In his role as the founder of the MMA art form, Riley has become an inspiration to many up and coming artists. However, the part Riley insists is most important to him, is that he's helped many troubled youth take control of their lives, and create their own unique, positive futuresponse. Seeing kids he's mentored graduate from high school and enroll in college, gives art the purpose that Riley so craves.</p><p>A first-year student at the Roux Academy of Art, Media, and Design, Riley is already changing the face of modern art at the university. Riley's exquisite abstract pieces have no intention of ever being understood, but instead beg the viewer to dream, create, pretend, and envision with their mind's eye. Riley will be speaking on the 'Art of Abstract' during Thursday's schedule.</p>",

Hillary's CAC exhibit features paintings that contain only water images including waves, deep sea, and river.</p><p>An avid water sports participant, Hillary understands the water in many ways in which others do not, or may not ever have the opportunity. Her goal in creating the CAC exhibit was to share with others the beauty, power, and flow of natural bodies of water throughout the world. In addition to the display, Hilary also hosts a session on Tuesday called Deep Sea Wonders, which combines her love of deep sea diving and snorkeling, with instruction for capturing the beauty of underwater explorations on canvas.</p>",
