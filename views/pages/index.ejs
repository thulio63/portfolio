        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Andrew Thul, I am a graduate of Illinois State University for the 
          Creative Technologies program. I currently work as an Assistant Technical 
          Director of Productions at ISU, but I also explore software development and 
          coding in a variety of different languages in my spare time. I also have a cat
          named Pearl, but she can only code in Python so I give her a hard time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m currently applying to grad school at ISU, but I&apos;m open to part time
          work and new careers if the right opportunity presents itself.
